Doxygen
=======

Doxygen is a tool for building documentation for source code e.g. inter-related HTML pages for C++ source code.

Usage
-----

Doxygen can be loaded with: ::

    module load Doxygen/1.8.15-GCCcore-8.2.0

NB Doxygen has a run-time dependency on ``libstdc++`` so the above also needs to
(and does) load the :ref:`GCC compiler <gcc_bessemer>` version 8.2.0.
